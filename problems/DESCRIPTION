1. Bug: multiple drop shadows
2. Bug: inclusion of tikz generated images in xelatex
   a. with standard pgf-blur files from CTAN/TeX Live
   b. with "fixed" pgf-blur from TeX StackExchange


1. Bug: multiple drop shadows
=============================

As mentioned a few times on TeX StackExchange, multiple usage of 
drop shadows in xelatex is broken.

See included file mwe-graphic.tex. With xelatex it produces wrong
shadows, but with lualatex or pdflatex perfectly fine ones.

Possible solution: Fixes incorporated into pst-blur by Andrew Stacey in
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~tex-sx/tex-sx/development/files

With this file (also included), multiple shadows work, but different
problems reappeared:


2. Bug: Inclusion of tikz generated images in xelatex broken
============================================================

The main file "mwe.tex" is always run with xelatex.

The differences arise due to:
* using xelatex/lualatex for he tikz image
* using a "fixed" version for pst-blur from
  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~tex-sx/tex-sx/development/files


a. with standard pgf-blur files from CTAN/TeX Live
--------------------------------------------------

* lualatex mwe-graphic.tex; xelatex mwe.tex

xdvipdfmx:fatal: Loop in object hierarchy detected. Broken PDF file?

* xelatex mwe-graphic.tex; xelatex mwe.tex

works, but broken shadows, see other bug.


a. with "fixed" pgf-blur from

* lualatex mwe-graphic.tex; xelatex ...
